Xpense is a virtual assistant impacting college students & emerging financial enthusiasts by teaching them how and where to invest smartly! Xpense not only tracks all your accounts and savings, but also show you possible mutual funds and bonds for investment with data visualizations of each opportunity for profit.

Xpense is a web application hosted on Azure using nodeJS. The consumer data and banking account information was all acquired using Capital One's Nessie API. The Twilio API was used to send user text message reminders regarding their progress. D3.JS was used to create all the data visualizations on the application.

One of the biggest challenges was to identify the best way to visualize financial data in the most effective way possible. We really wanted to make these visualizations non-intimidating to even the least financially savvy people.

We are pleased that we were able to make Xpense very user friendly so that even the least computer savvy people can easily use our application.
